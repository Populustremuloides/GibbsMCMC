# GibbsMCMC

This is code for a Gibbs sampler for the MCMC2 lab for CS 677.

You can find the results under the files

[crazy_results.csv](crazy_results.csv)

[faculty_results.csv](faculty_results.csv)

[golfer_results.csv](golfer_results.csv)

[gaussian_results.csv](gaussian_results.csv) (You'll notice that this one shows how a gaussian process is like gibbs sampling. The nodes A, G, and J were observed as 0, 10, and 0, respectively. Kinda fun!)
